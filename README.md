# Nirvana

##Glue for .NET and UI applications

**Nirvana n. nir·va·na  (nîr-vä′nə, nər-)**

###1. In Buddhism, a state in which the mind, enlightened as to the illusory nature of the self, transcends all suffering and attains peace.

###2 In Hinduism - a state in which the soul, having relinquished individual attachments and recognized its identity with Brahman, escapes samsara.

###3 An ideal condition of rest, harmony, stability, or joy.



I am tired of writing the same boilerplate code over and over for CQRS - my latest side project is an Angular 2 app using WebAPI, and I've decided to open source and create a nuget package for everything I'm working on.  I had the idea for 6ish months to use ROslyn to create my endpoints, and when it all came together it was magical!

Why Nirvana?  I thought it was fitting becuase of a few things - the harmony between UI and middle .NET layer ( and separation of concerns), the simplicity and speed for adding business features, and the happiness that I get when working with it vs. everything else I've ever used.  

I am open to feedback, and will accept pull requests, but until I have a better set of tests to validate changes I won't be rolling any suggestions into the system.


[Wiki What?](https://github.com/jasoncavaliere/Nirvana/wiki) - yah more coming on this later, but at least it'll show you how to peek the code in the mean time.


Features coming:
- Plugin for EventStore
- Ability to configure which controllers to use when standing up an endpoint.
- Ability to stand up a test endpoint ( with examples for test data)
- A seprate Angular 2 seed project that uses the output of the webapi
- A working WebAPI seed app that can be downloaded and run.


Questions? Comments? Concerns?  Feel free to shoot me a note.
